# Interactive-Sound-Table
Interactive Sound Table is a hybrid musical instrument. It allows the user to play the tones of different musical instruments  on a single table, thus the name. The project involves a table over which the user can move multiple blocks. Each block represents a musical instrument. Different tones can be heard for different positions of blocks. The tones produced by all the blocks mix together and form a nice rythme.
Project - Making
FL-STUDIO : Made different instrumental music tracks on FL-STUDIO which can be mixed to output a melodious music. 
Python : Built an algorithm on python to detect the colours of the objects. Divided the area captured by webcam into three regions. The centre of mass of the object is calculated and the song is played according to the region the centre of mass falls in.The code we built is as follows:
Scope of Improvement
The detection of different objects can be made specific by using any aspect other than colour.
Introduce machine learning into the project to make it make it more efficient.
